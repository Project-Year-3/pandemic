  Pandemic Dynamics
  </h1>
  
  <p>
  Get acquainted with the fundamental principles of pandemic dynamics by
  exploring the basic foundations of exponential growth.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  <h3>
  Learning Outcomes:
  </h3>
  <ul>
  <li>
  Acquire factual knowledge of pandemics, including historical background and
  the biology of viruses.
  </li>
  <li>
  Recognise the mathematical underpinnings of exponential growth in viral
  outbreaks.
  </li>
  <li>
  Gain a basic understanding of the various factors that feed into determining
  the course of an outbreak.
  </li>
  <li>
  Learn to recognise pandemic-like processes in areas other than epidemiology,
  such as radioactive decay, gene-selection in evolution and the spread of
  ideas in a population.
  </li>
  </ul>
  </p>
